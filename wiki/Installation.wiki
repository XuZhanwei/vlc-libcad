#summary Installation instructions.
== Installation ==

- Note that VLC 1.1.x is required. The plugin will not work on VLC 1.2.0 beta versions (VLC 1.2.0 will be supported when it's officially released).

- First, close VLC media player. Then, download the latest version of the libcad plugin for VLC from [http://code.google.com/p/vlc-libcad/downloads/list here]

- Extract the downloaded archive and copy the *libcad_plugin.dll* file into your VLC plugins folder (usually located in *C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\plugins*)

- Open VLC and select *Tools -> Preferences*. First, click on *All* under "Show settings" (*<font color="red">1.</font>*). Then, expand *Interface -> Control interfaces* (*<font color="red">2.</font>*). Check *CAD Now-Playing* (*<font color="red">3.</font>*) and then Save (*<font color="red">4.</font>*).

- For the changes to take effect you must restart VLC. Enjoy!
